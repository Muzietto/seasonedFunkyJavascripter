Seasoned Funky Javascripter
===========================

This is an implementation of the operations described in the Seasoned Schemer. It uses only
crisp clear Javascript lists; no arrays whatsoever in the way. Everything is a function.

See more details about all this inside the companion project Little Funky Javascripter.

A complete test suite using YUI is enclosed. Whilst debugging, the method <cons>.c shows a pretty print of the current list.
